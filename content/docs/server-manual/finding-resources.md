  Finding resources for your FiveM server.
---

Resources can be used to add functionality to your FiveM server, you can find many of the available resources in the [Releases](https://forum.cfx.re/c/development/releases/7) section.

Some may be free and others may not, the forum has filtering functionality so you can sort through them.

{{% alert color="warning" title="Dependencies" %}}Some resources may have dependencies, as in may depend on other resources (so do your research prior to picking a resource, or things may not work). Resources under the [**standalone**](https://forum.cfx.re/tags/c/development/releases/7/standalone) tag, typically don't have this. {{% /alert %}}

# Responsibility
Use at your own risk. Resources are community driven and you should pick them carefully. FiveM is not responsible for any event following its use, and will not provide support for community made resources. Make sure to follow the resource terms and conditions. Resources generally have a way to communicate with the creator for support, use the available lines in the event an issue arises.

{{% alert color="warning" title="Be careful" %}}If you decide to purchase any resources, make sure they are being sold through [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/fivem) to avoid scams. FiveM does not hold itself accountable for any resources and you should be diligent/careful in purchasing anything online. {{% /alert %}}
